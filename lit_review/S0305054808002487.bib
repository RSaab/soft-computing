abstract = "Hub location problems deal with finding the location of hub facilities and with the allocation of demand nodes to these located hub facilities. In this paper, we study the single allocation hub covering problem over incomplete hub networks and propose an integer programming formulation to this end. The aim of our model is to find the location of hubs, the hub links to be established between the located hubs, and the allocation of non-hub nodes to the located hub nodes such that the travel time between any origin–destination pair is within a given time bound. We present an efficient heuristic based on tabu search and test the performance of our heuristic on the CAB data set and on the Turkish network."
