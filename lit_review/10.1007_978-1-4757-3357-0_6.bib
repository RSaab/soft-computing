abstract="In this paper we present new hub location models which are applicable for urban public transportation networks. In order to obtain such models we relax some of the general assumptions that are usually satisfied in hub location problems, but which are not useful for public transportation networks. For instance we do not require that the hub nodes have to be completely interconnected. These new models are based on network design formulations, in which the constraint that all flow has to be routed via some hub nodes is formulated by a flow conservation law. We present some solution approaches for these new models and illustrate the results on a numerical example.",
